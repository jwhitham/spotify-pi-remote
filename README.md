# spotify-pi-remote

This Python program allows remote access to some simple
Spotify functions, namely play/pause/previous and next track.

The intended usage is to run the Spotify app elsewhere, e.g. on a PC, 
and then use this remote control to quickly skip tracks you don't
like and replay ones that you do. At my house it is attached
to a Concept 2 rowing machine.

For detailed setup instructions, see setup.txt.

The RPi has no buttons of its own, so some hardware
needs to be built and connected to the GPIO port.
